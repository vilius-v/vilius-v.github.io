                <p>
                Welcome to a page all about me, Vilius Vy&#353;niauskas! I am a computer 
                engineer originally from Lithuania and currently situated in Los Angeles, 
                California. A fresh graduate from UCLA, I look forward to gaining 
                experience and contributing to the world of technology, computer 
                science, and engineering.
                </p>
                <p>
                Growing up in my homeland of Lithuania has allowed me to develop a 
                unique perspective on the world. I am incredibly fortunate to have had
                the opportunity to experience the world from two completely different 
                viewpoints, socially and economically. This has taught me to approach 
                problems from more than one angle and to always refine my solutions. Being 
                a multi-cultured and world-travelled young adult studying computer 
                engineering has helped me understand the technological needs of the current
                world and the impact of collaboration on a global scale.
                </p>
                <p>
                My greatest interest is tinkering - with software, circuit boards, LEGOs, 
                and everything I can get my hands on. For this reason I became an engineer. 
                It is a field of exploration and discovery, and that motivates me every 
                time a challenge appears. This adventure of inventing new things and 
                extending existing ideas yields the best results with cooperation. To 
                promote this mindset, I joined the computer science honors club at 
                UCLA, called 
                <a href="https://upe.seas.ucla.edu/">Upsilon Pi Epsilon (UPE)</a>, as 
                the tutoring chair. Teaching others has this great effect in that it 
                also makes me a better engineer, more careful and precise, so I strive 
                to pass down my knowledge when possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                Throughout my career at UCLA, I have taken courses in both computer
                science and electrical engineering curriculums. From circuit analysis,
                digital design, and schematic optimization to operating systems, 
                networking, and algorithms, my time at UCLA has given me a wide breadth
                of knowledge. During my 4 undegraduate years, I gained a deep 
                understanding of C/C++ and low level system programming which has enabled
                me to expand my interests and proficiency in other areas as well.
                For a full list of my skills, take a look at my

                        The goal of this project was to design a physical 6-bit absolute
                        value detector with a worst case delay of 1 nanosecond and 
                        minimum energy. Only static logic (pass-transistor or CMOS) 
                        was allowed. Here is the final
                        <a href="projects/neural/report.pdf" target="_blank">report</a>
                        and the full list of the 
                        <a href="projects/neural/spec.pdf" target="_blank">requirements</a>. 
                        The three most important features of the design are:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Elimination of the need for separate adder (to create |x|)</li>
                            <li>Carry look-ahead logic combines absolute value and comparator into one stage</li>
                            <li>Efficient, high-level design minimized transistor count</li>

                        This project taught me about CMOS logic design, implementation, and
                        optimization in addition to valuable experience with industry
                        software and general techniques associated with digital electronic
                        circuits.

                        A web app created to help college students share music easily 
                        and conveniently. This web app uses a combination of JS and Go 
                        to integrate with the <b>Spotify API</b> and provide a web page 
                        front-end for users to interact with. It allows for a single host 
                        to share a "party" code, linked to his or her Spotify playlist, 
                        which enables all friends with a code to add music to the host's 
                        Spotify account.

                        This is currently a feature not supported by Spotify itself - 
                        Spotify requires a person to have a registered

                        credentials from other users but internally uses the host account 
                        to add all music to the desired Spotify playlist.

                        digital holography

                        to reconstruct and identify, in real-time, floating algae particles
                        in a current. We achieved a throughput of 100mL per hour at 3 
                        frames per second. The main algorithm had four steps:

                        <p>
                        The aim of this project was to construct a web client 
                        that supports sending HTTP/1.0 GET requests and parsing 
                        HTTP/1.0 responses, as well as a web server that 
                        supports parsing HTTP/1.0 GET requests and sending HTTP/1.0
                        responses. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        The design consists of the following three layers:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Obtaining and abstracting the parsing of HTTP/1.0 GET requests and responses</li>
                            <li>The web client, which encompasses the creation of a 
                            socket and the sending and receiving of HTTP requests via 
                            this socket.</li>
                            <li>The web server, which hosts files in a given directory
                            (on a plausible network hostname and port of the 
                            user’s choice) and accepts multiple incoming connections 
                            from multiple web clients.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
